brain dump of things we need to move forward

= design questions
    * single threaded?
    * how will we backtest?
    * gui? controll the apps?
    * internal structures? ie, how will the normalised orderbook / tick / quote / trade data look?
    = connectinos 
	* websocket / REST / FIX - probably need to get all these coded up 
	* guis? 

= exchagnes
    * research exchagnes 
	* which exchagnes we need to connect to
	* locations of matching engines 
        * how to connect / best cloud servers to conenct into for best latency 
	* how to bypass cloudfront / cloudflare CDNS if possible 
	* exchagnes with margin ?
    * how should we sign up 

= infrastructure
    * if all goes to plan and we have a fair few servers all over the placae we will 
      need to have some form of cloud infra manager, i have been looking at terraform
      for this, it looks like it will abstract away which cloud vendor we are using 
      to speed up deployment
    * same goes for config management, probably look at puppet, ansible, or, salt stack
