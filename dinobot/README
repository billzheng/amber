================ Quick source description =====================================
===============================================================================
I decided to call the project dinobot (with strategies named after 
transformers), I'm not attached to this name in any way, so change if we want. 

Directory structure is as follows (roughly):

dinbot/
    dinobot/
	build - build dir , can be named anything really        
	conf  - config files to run the apps
	src   - source code for the apps 
    external/
	ccxt -  python library for some exchange connectivity, seems usefull 
		so we don't have to reimplement the wheel for certain 
		operations that are not latency critical (plus each exchange 
		now will have the same interface to speed up development).
	uWebsockets - weboscket lib, this is the fastest one i could find. 
		The build system will look for the uWebSockets.tar.gz at 
		every build, so it needs to stay there. 
    scripts/
	scripts used to start / stop engine. talk to exchagne etc. all the 
	usual glue things we need. 


Notes: 
    + build system: CMake 
    + Boost only used for beast (the new HTTP rest endpoint (only available 
      since 1.66) 
    + tested builds on MAc/OSX (latest with brew openssl and boost) also
      builds on fedora >= 28 using system openssl and boost. 
    + should add ccxt and uWebsockets as git submodules so we don't need in 
      our repos

================ How to build =================================================
===============================================================================
After checking out the repo you can do the following 

1. edit CMakeLists.txt and add you name and environment set up.
2. make a build dir 
    cd dinobot/dinobot
    makedir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make 
3. python3 scripts/generate_daily_symbol_data.py  -o /data/ 
4. run the app (the config references files generated by the script above, 
   if you choose another location you may need to modify the configs files.
    src/marketdata_recorders/marketdata_recorder -c ../conf/binance_marketdata.ini

Done. i think.
